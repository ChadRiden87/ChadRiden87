### Top-performing, very language-flexible full stack developer with 9+ years of experience 
####   I'm a top-performing, very language-flexible full stack developer with 9+ years of experience in responsive web development using PHP, Laravel, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Tailwind, Node, JavaScript, TypeScript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and the cloud platform at New York's leading IT companies. My work experience includes a wide range of software development, from software architecture, database design to website/web app development.
####   I have worked with the Agile development methodology to build test-driven code both as a developer and as a scrum master and have experience with many software design models & patterns like MVC, Singleton, etc. 
####   Also, I work well with other team members (mentoring and leadership) and always find the opportunity to brainstorm. 
####   I love creative, innovative companies/clients who focus on improving their products, as well as the growth of their employees.
####   My other interests include golf, gaming, and music.
